# taipy-data-node-lock
"Taipy Data Node Locking Mechanism Implementation"  This project adds a locking mechanism to Taipy's DataNode and FileDataNode classes. It prevents data modification if the node is being edited by another process, ensuring data integrity. Includes exception handling (DataNodeIsBeingEdited) and unit tests for full coverage.
